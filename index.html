                <h3>Protocol</h3>
                <p>Protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is exhanged within or between computers.</p>
                <p>These rules include what what data may be transmitted, the commands used to send and recieve that data and how the transfers are confirmed. Protocol is sometimes compaired to the spoken language.</p>

                <h3>HTTP</h3>
                <P>Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and defines a language for clients and servers to speak to commuticate. It is an application for transmitting hypermedia documents like HTML. </P>
                
                <h3>HTTPS</h3>
                <p>The S stands for Secure and it protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user and the website.</p>

                <h3>Cache</h3>
                <p>Cache is the process of storing a copy of a given resource data and sending it back when requested. Caching reduces latency and network traffic. By reusing previously fetched features the performance and responsiveness of web application can be improved.</p>

                <h3>Web hosting and Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>Traditional Web hosting is either shared or dediated. With dedicated hosting the client pays for all the resources of one or more servers from the provider. With shared hosting the client pays for a set amount of storage on a single server that is shared with other websites.</p>
                <p>Cloud computing has more scalability where the client pays only for the storage that is used. Cloud hosting balances the load across multiple mirrored servers and is therefore more secure if one server goes down.</p>

                <p>Static pages are written with languages like HTML, Javascript, CSS and it is hardcoded on a page. Static page data does not change until someone does so manually. They show the same content for every user.</p> 
                <p>Dynamic pages are structured by referencing some external database like CGI, AJAX, ASP. Dynamic website can display different content and provide user interacion.</p>
